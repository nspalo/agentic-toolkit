# Workspace Identity

## What This Workspace Is

This is an AI-assisted development workspace for {{CONTEXT}}.

It contains project-specific knowledge, test cases, investigation reports, JIRA tickets, and documentation produced during development.

## Active Projects

| Project Code | Code Repo(s) | Artifacts Directory | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — |

## Routing Rules

When producing artifacts (reports, test cases, tickets, KB articles), place them in the correct project directory based on which project is being worked on.

**How to determine the active project:**
1. Check which project context was loaded at session start
2. Check which code repo the user is actively working in
3. If ambiguous, ask: "Which project should this go under?"

## File Placement (Universal)

Every project directory follows this structure:

| Content type | Path within project |
|---|---|
| Project context | `project-context.md` |
| JIRA ticket docs | `technical-notes/jira/tickets/` |
| Epic docs | `technical-notes/jira/epics/` |
| Design proposals | `technical-notes/jira/proposals/` |
| Investigation reports | `technical-notes/investigation/YYYYMMDD-name/` |
| Test cases | `testcases/` |
| System diagrams | `system-diagrams/` |
| Knowledge base | `knowledge-base/` |
| Documentation | `documentation/` |
| Generated output | `generated-files/` (gitignored) |
| Draft steering | `.kiro-draft/steering/` |
| Draft hooks | `.kiro-draft/hooks/` |

## Naming Conventions

- All files: kebab-case, lowercase
- Exceptions: JIRA project codes stay uppercase (e.g., `PROJ-001-fix-name.md`)
- Exceptions: Test cases use `TCNNN.md` / `TCNNN-A.md` format
- Exceptions: `README.md`
- Numbered prefixes: `00-`, `01-`, `02-` (for ordered sequences)

## What Does NOT Go Here

- Source code (goes in project repos)
- Generic methodology (goes in the toolkit repo)
- Credentials or secrets
